## What is git-adr?

git-adr is a CLI tool for managing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) using git notes instead of files in your repository. This approach:

- Keeps your working tree clean (no ADR files)
- Integrates seamlessly with git workflows
- Survives rebases and amends
- Can be synced across remotes
